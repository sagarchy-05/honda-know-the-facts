              A key to our success is what we call the “Associate Voice.” When
              associates have ideas or concerns about a production process or
              policy, we encourage them to speak up and welcome their
              involvement in our efforts to improve our operations. Our success
              depends on it! <br /><br />
              In fact, the “Associate Voice” is a formal initiative implemented
              across every Honda production facility in America. The more we
              listen, the more valuable insights we receive from associates, and
              the better our company and products become. <br /><br />
              <span>
                Every time we introduce a new product, Honda associates
                contribute hundreds of suggestions to change the design or
                processes to make it easier to build. We don’t know of another
                automaker where production associates have such a strong voice
                in new vehicle design or company policies.</span
              >
              <br /><br />
              Most recently, based on associate feedback, we launched numerous
              new benefits under our Employment Experience initiative, including
              paid family leave, a childcare reimbursement account, home buyer
              support and a lifestyle reimbursement account. <br /><br />
              We will continue to invest in our people, value their ideas and
              work together to create products of the highest quality for our
              customers and maintain the unprecedented job security for our
              associates.

          WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON COMMUNICATION WHEN A UNION IS PRESENT AT A
          MANUFACTURING COMPANY?
        </div>
        <div class="third-text">
          <div class="just-text">
            The UAW creates and fosters an “us vs. them” attitude in the
            workplace. The UAW needs this divisive environment in order to claim
            it can fix it. An “us vs. them” approach is not good for anyone, but
            that’s the union’s first and most important goal.
            <br /><br />
            The UAW is a business with a bureaucracy and a “pecking order” of
            communication. The UAW’s system of local officers and “shop
            chairmen” intrudes on a company’s free flow of information and makes
            each associate’s access to knowledge more difficult. <br /><br />
            <span
              >The union’s first goal is always preservation of the union
              itself.</span
            >
            <br /><br />Self-preservation is placed ahead of any workplace
            objectives set by associates or a company. <br /><br />
            Communication between associates and management must flow quickly
            and honestly. But in the UAW model, critical information must flow
            through the ranks of the union officer system. Therefore,
            communication is slowed down and delayed as union officials evaluate
            information and what associates should hear or, in many cases, not
            hear.

            How does UAW communication compare with Honda?

          <div class="text-like">
            The UAW system is at odds with the basic principles of Honda, where
            it’s understood that all our voices and viewpoints should be
            considered.

              In this way, associate concerns are reflected to the actions of
              the company. Importantly, associate information can be put to work
              quickly to solve a problem or improve a process. When it comes to
              operating on the plant floor, speed of communication is critical
              for the safety of our associates and the quality of our products.

            <br /><br />Having an outside party like the UAW, that is not
            invested in our success as a company and is not familiar with how
            our systems work, does not lend itself to the principles of
            continuous improvement that are embedded in the Honda Way and that
            are held in the hands of our fellow associates.
