              A Union Card Is A Legal Document

              The principle to remember is that a Union Authorization Card is a
              <span
                >legal document that transfers rights you have today as a Honda
                associate to a union. </span
              >A signed card also lengthens the union organizing effort since it
              is valid for 12 months after it is signed. During the card-signing
              phase of a campaign, an unsigned card can send a message that you
              don’t want the union and you want the union’s drive to end. You
              should take great care and caution in deciding whether to sign,
              just as you would any other important legal document.
            </div>
            <div class="second-para">
              Also, be aware that if the union collects signed cards from 50% of
              associates, it can automatically become your collective bargaining
              representative, without an election.

              Many workers complain that organizers attempt to pressure or
              intimidate them during a union campaign. The union supporter will
              ask a worker to sign a card and not leave the worker alone. Or,
              the union supporter will even come to their homes to pressure them
              into signing. <br /><br />
              <span>
                If someone reaches out to you – either in person or online – and
                asks you to sign, you have the right to say “no,” and the union
                supporter cannot pressure you. The union supporter must respect
                your decision.</span

              If someone comes to your door, you do not have to talk to them, or
              you can tell them that you prefer to keep business separate from
              family life.

            <span>This statement is misleading. Read the card.</span> <br />
            <br />Whether an online card or a physical card, be aware that
            signing it says that you “authorize the UAW to represent me in
            collective bargaining.”
