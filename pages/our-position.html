              Honda, we’ve done it for more than 40 years. A union would not

            By promoting a positive and safe work environment and integrating

            have produced world- class products that exceed our customers’

            through challenging times, while maintaining our competitive edge in
            the marketplace. That’s why so many associates have made lifelong
            careers at Honda, and why we have multiple generations of “Honda

            union outreach efforts.
