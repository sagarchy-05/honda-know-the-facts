                  Why is the UAW trying to convince Honda associates to join the
                  union?

                    The simple answer is money … for the union. The UAW is
                    trying to increase their dues paying members. A UAW official
                    stated, “If we don’t organize these transnationals, I don’t
                    think there’s a long-term future for the UAW, I really
                    don’t.” We know the UAW’s wide margins of defeat in recent
                    elections at other automakers were further setbacks in the
                    UAW’s efforts to grow their membership.

                    The UAW is a business. UAW revenues, estimated at $290
                    million annually, come primarily from their members. Because
                    membership has declined from 1.5 million to a little over
                    400,000 in the last 30+ years, they need new members. Their
                    campaign is an attempt to convince Honda associates of the
                    value and quality of their representation. Union dues vary,
                    but the typically cost unionized employees a full 2 ½ hours
                    of pay per month – which equals nearly one week’s worth of
                    work annually. Do you really want to lose a week’s worth of
                    pay every year?

                    The UAW is paying union organizers to come here to recruit
                    Honda associates. The organizers operate much like
                    salespeople and will make claims, raise issues and offer
                    promises. Their claims may be directed at individuals and
                    may not be accurate. Each associate must carefully evaluate
                    the UAW’s claims and promises against Honda’s record and the
                    UAW’s record.

                    While a union can make promises, its ability to deliver on
                    those promises depends on collective bargaining. The
                    bargaining process can have a variety of outcomes, none of
                    which is guaranteed. One thing the UAW cannot promise is job
                    security. Their record clearly shows work stoppages due to
                    strikes and plant closures, even layoffs after signing new
                    collective bargaining agreements.

                    Freedom of speech is a fundamental principle that applies in
                    any union campaign. Associates who are supportive – or not
                    supportive – of the union’s efforts may distribute
                    literature at Honda locations. Non-Honda associates are not
                    permitted to distribute literature on Honda property. They
                    can distribute material on public property subject to local
                    safety laws or online.

                    Since Honda associates are the best and most secure
                    workforce in the auto industry, it’s easy to see why the UAW
                    would want the steady income from our associates. It is well
                    documented that the UAW is suffering, after losing more than
                    70% of its dues paying members in the past 30+ years due to
                    layoffs, retirements and plant closings.

                    We have built our success together, with unequaled job

                    associates to do two things: know the facts and respect each
                    other. Associates are not only encouraged – you are
                    permitted by law – to ask questions about a claim made by
                    the UAW or about information provided by the union. Your
                    leaders and other management members are available to talk
                    with you about UAW activity or answer any other questions
                    you have.

                    Many of the accusations made by the UAW take a cookie
                    cutter, one-size-fits-all approach – despite the fact that
                    none of it applies to Honda. Using arguments based on the
                    experience of UAW workers at other automakers is not
                    productive. Honda has an outstanding record of working
                    directly with its associates to advance safety in the
                    workplace and to improve production processes to make our
                    products easier to build. There is no reason to change this
                    collaborative and successful approach.
